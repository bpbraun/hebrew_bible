# Computational Humanities: Exploring the Hebrew Bible (AKA the ToRah Project)

This repository hosts scripts and data for a computational humanities project focused on analyzing the Hebrew Bible. Using XML data from [Tanach.us](https://tanach.us/), the goal is to apply data science, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques to explore this foundational text.

## Project Overview

This project begins by parsing and structuring the XML files of the Hebrew Bible into a machine-readable format. The next steps include building word embeddings and conducting0data science experiments—ranging from textual analysis and clustering to visualization and machine learning.

The ultimate aim is to uncover linguistic, literary, and historical patterns within the text, leveraging computational tools to enrich understanding and scholarship in the humanities.

## Current Features

- **XML Parsing**: Extracts chapters, verses, and text into a structured format.
- **Documentary Hypothesis Integration**: Annotates Torah verses with their Documentary Hypothesis source.
- **Canonical Order Preservation**: Ensures books and verses are ordered according to their traditional sequence.

## Planned Features

- **Word Embeddings**: Build Hebrew word embeddings to explore semantic relationships within the text.
- **Text Analysis**: Perform clustering, topic modeling, and other NLP tasks to uncover textual patterns.
- **Visualization**: Create compelling visualizations of linguistic or thematic trends.
- **Comparative Studies**: Enable side-by-side comparisons with other ancient texts.

## Data Source and License

The XML data for the Hebrew Bible comes from [Tanach.us](https://tanach.us/), a comprehensive and meticulously prepared digital edition of the Masoretic text. This project adheres to the license conditions outlined in the [Tanach.us License](https://tanach.us/License.html).
